# The Hootline — Daily Briefing — February 21, 2026


**PODCAST PRODUCTION INSTRUCTIONS:**
This document is organized into numbered segments. When generating the podcast:
- Begin with a warm welcome
- Present each segment in order, using the segment title as a transition
- Each segment has a word budget — spend roughly proportional time on it
- Skip any segment that contains no articles
- Use a conversational but informative tone throughout
- Summarize and discuss the key points from each article, do not read them verbatim
- Transition smoothly between segments with brief bridges
- End with a brief wrap-up and sign-off


## INTRO (~1 minute)

Mainstream Media Is Getting Nervous. We’re Not.

There’s A Dangerous Shift Happening In American Media Right Now.
The Washington Post laid off more than 300 journalists. CBS is kowtowing to bullies. Major outlets are hedging. Softening. Calibrating their coverage to avoid backlash.
This moment is exactly why
The Stranger
exists. We were built to say what we think -- clearly, loudly, and without permission.
We can do this work only if we are accountable to you, not outside interests.
$15 covers the public records request that unlocks the story.
$25 funds an hour of fact-checking before we hit publish.
$50 buys the train ticket to interview someone whose voice would otherwise go unheard.
$75 supports newsroom tech and publishing software.
$100 helps cover legal review so powerful people can’t bully stories into silence.
If you believe the media should not bend to political intimidation, we hope you will stand with us now.

### Opinion Today: It’s OK if your medical advice comes from A.I.

Opinion Today: It’s OK if your medical advice comes from A.I.
|
nytimes.com
February 21, 2026
Tom Gauld
By Adam Rodman
Dr. Rodman is the director of A.I. programs for the Carl J. Shapiro Center for Education and Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
“The secret of the care of the patient is in caring for the patient.” The American physician Francis Peabody wrote those words a century ago, and after more than a decade of practicing medicine, I believe them now as much as ever. I also believe that large language models are the most powerful tool ever invented for patients to engage in their own health. Most people assume these two convictions must be in conflict. They aren’t.
My recommendations, which I wrote about in a
recent guest essay
, have real urgency behind them. Artificial intelligence is already here in medicine, and it’s not going away. Right now, there are two competing models for the future of health care. In the first, care becomes dyadic: Patients interact directly with A.I. with no humans involved, except as remote safety oversight. Even if A.I. could serve as a primary care doctor (which it cannot do right now), I doubt that anyone wants a future in which a life-altering diagnosis like cancer is delivered by an algorithm.
The second model is triadic, one in which patient, doctor and A.I. work together. A.I. extends the doctor-patient relationship, helping to prepare for visits, making medication adjustments and addressing new concerns, all while keeping the doctor in the loop and turning things over to the doctor when human judgment and compassion are necessary. We don’t get to this future by pretending that A.I. isn’t already in the clinic. If we do nothing, we get dyadic care, and there are plenty of A.I. doctor start-ups more than willing to take us there. But by being open and transparent — and encouraging safe and appropriate use of A.I. — we can take the first steps to a future medicine that uses this new, powerful technology without abandoning its foundation: human relationships.

## SEGMENT 5: CrossFit (~2 minutes)
**Word budget: ~300 words**

### one of life's great memories

one of life's great memories
Ok athlete, let me take you back to 2013. Hey, it's Jeremy again.
I’d been doing CrossFit for 18 months and had just entered my first competition, the CrossFit Open.
When I saw the first workout, “
Open 13.1
,” I started strategizing:
AMRAP in 17 minutes
40 Burpees
30 Snatches (75/45 lb)
30 Burpees
30 Snatches (135/75 lb)
20 Burpees
30 Snatches (165/100 lb)
10 Burpees
Max Snatches (210/120 lb)
I saw those snatch weights and thought:
“I’ve never even snatched 135 lb before. I guess I’ll just finish the 30 burpees as fast as I can and, um … stare at the 135 lb barbell for the rest of the time. FUN!”
Sure enough, I finished the 30 burpees and was staring at that 135 lb barbell.
I still had several minutes left on the clock.
My coach, Alex, told me to try a snatch. Nothing to lose, I guess.
I tried. Not even close.
… the barbell didn’t even get past my shoulders.
I dropped it.
… took a breath.
Coach said “give it another shot.”
I set up. I pulled.
And I failed again.
And again.
(And again...)
You get the picture.
I probably failed that snatch 10 times.
Then with 5 seconds left on the clock, I thought:
“I’m going to give it everything I’ve got.”
I pulled hard, it felt light, and somehow I landed in a squat with the barbell locked out overhead.
I was shocked! Fired up! Felt like I unlocked a whole new level!
As I stood, I let out this growling, celebratory yell from deep in my belly.
The clock stopped. The workout ended. And my yell filled the gym.
Everyone turned to look at me … and cheered.
I celebrated with my coach like I just won the Open. Hugs and fist bumps all around.
It was a quintessential CrossFit Open experience - hitting a new PR at the end of an Open workout.
