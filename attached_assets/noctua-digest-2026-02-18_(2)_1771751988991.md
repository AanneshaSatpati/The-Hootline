### What’s up with these “cool girl” blazers?

What’s up with these “cool girl” blazers?
February 18, 2026
These chic, oversize blazers are popular for a reason
Ruthie Darling/NYT Wirecutter
“The Frankie Shop has done the impossible,” says style writer Frances Solá-Santiago. “It has made blazers (shoulder pads and all) actually cool again.” The trendy brand, known for its trademark oversize silhouette, has a devoted following among celebrities, influencers, and businesswomen.
But are these minimalist, loose-fitting jackets actually worth the hype and the price tag?

Good morning, world!
China has been good at a lot of things: manufacturing cheaply, catching up on A.I., dominating renewable energy, building hard power. What it’s been less good at is soft power. But that seems to be changing. Have you heard about Chinamaxxing? Read on.
Today, my colleague Vivian Wang in Beijing writes about how China is suddenly winning hearts and minds. (Spoiler alert: It might not actually have that much to do with China itself.)

### I was in the worst shape of my life

I was in the worst shape of my life
Hi athlete, it's Jeremy here.
As a new dad, I had gotten into the worst shape of my life.
It was not OK.
It was even affecting my mental health.
I didn’t know anything about functional fitness at the time, but I heard that a gym opened nearby.
… So I signed up and gave it a shot.
I knew I wasn’t at my fittest, but I had no idea how out of shape I was…
Like most people who try this kind of intense training for the first time, I thought they were trying to kill me.
But once I regained consciousness, I knew I loved it. I kept going back for more.
The rest is history.
(I drank the kool-aid.)
Still, every workout was a new challenge.
EVERY. ONE.
And even though I constantly finished at the bottom of the leaderboard and had to
scale
everything, I loved being able to measure my workouts – and my progress.
I knew there was something different about this type of "functional" training.
And the more I learned, the more I wanted to know.
Maybe other athletes wanted to do the same?
So Lisa and I
started WODwell
as a hobby, to learn about and discover new workouts.
WODwell has since become the world’s best known curated collection of WODs with a global community of fitness fanatics (many of whom now
train with us
).
Before we built our own training platform, WODwell was just a site that let you find workout ideas. You can still use WODwell to
find WODs
for inspiration,
keep track of favorites
, and
log your results
for free
.
Happy training!
Jeremy (and Coach Lisa)
WODwell | Co-Creators
P.S.
CrossFit and functional fitness changed both of our lives. We hope you get as much from this kind of training as we have.
You opted in on our website.
