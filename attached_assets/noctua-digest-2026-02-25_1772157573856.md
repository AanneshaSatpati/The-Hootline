- The script flows as a continuous narrative — do NOT announce topic changes mechanically ("now let's talk about...")
- Blend between topics with natural transitions and conversational bridges
- Use a conversational but informative two-host format

Welcome, humans.
A
senior US Trump admin official just confirmed
that DeepSeek used NVIDIA's most advanced Blackwell chips, which are explicitly banned from export to China, to train its next model at a data center in Inner Mongolia.
Officials also allege DeepSeek used "distillation" from Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI models to boost it. Smuggled American chips + borrowed American AI knowledge = competitive Chinese model.
If this story is not already a Netflix pitch, somebody’s slackin’.
NVIDIA reports earnings later today, and every analyst in the room will be asking about this.
Our bet is on DeepSeek dropping the v4 model right in time to crash the market. They’re a hedge fund, after all; why not play to their strengths?
Here’s what happened in AI today:
Inception launched Mercury 2, a diffusion LLM that doesn't generate text... it edits it. Plus, we interviewed the founder.
The Pentagon gave Anthropic a Friday ultimatum on AI safeguards.
Anthropic launched 11 enterprise plugins for Cowork, turning Claude into a specialized agent for HR, finance, engineering, and more.
MatX raised $500M to compete with NVIDIA and build better chips.

This New AI Model Doesn't Write Like Every Other AI. It Edits.
Our interview with Stefano Ermon, related to today’s news!
DEEP DIVE:
What happens when you give AI an editor's instincts instead of a typewriter's patience?
Every AI model you've ever used writes the same way: one word at a time, left to right, like a typewriter. If it drifts off course early, tough luck. It keeps typing.
Well, Inception Labs just launched
Mercury 2
, which is an AI that works completely differently:
Instead of predicting one word after another, it starts with a rough sketch of the entire answer.
Then, it refines everything at once, like an editor revising a full draft in parallel.
The technical term is a "diffusion LLM" (dLLM), which uses the same core approach behind AI image generators like Midjourney, but applied to text and reasoning.
Let us tell you, the speed is real.

Airia: Enterprise AI orchestration that unifies experimentation, prod, and governance (Sponsor)
You want AI to be more than a never-ending work in progress, and that means enabling no-code, low-code, and pro-code development without IT gatekeepers standing in the way. Yet that doesn't mean governance goes out the window.
Airia is the enterprise AI platform
built to drive AI adoption by unifying innovation and security. Teams at Stryker, BuzzFeed, and ArcelorMittal use it to:
Test prompts, LLMs, and agent variants in safe, prod-like environments
End AI anxiety by controlling agent sprawl and
implementing automatic guardrails

Pentagon Gives Anthropic Ultimatum and Deadline in AI Use Standoff (5 minute read)
Anthropic has until Friday to comply with the Pentagon's demands to use its AI models for all lawful use cases, including mass domestic surveillance or autonomous weapons, which Anthropic doesn't allow its models to be used for. Failing to comply will mean the cancellation of Anthropic's contract. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said he could also label the company a supply-chain risk or invoke the Defense Production Act to essentially force Anthropic to work more collaboratively with the Pentagon. Designating a company as a supply-chain risk would mean that businesses working with the Pentagon would have to certify that they don't use Anthropic's models in any of their work with the military.

### The World: Is Cuba next?
The World: Is Cuba next?

Katrin Bennhold
Good morning, world!
I traveled to Cuba two decades ago. Fidel Castro was still president. The poverty was palpable. But the level of self-confidence, health care and education was higher than what I’d seen in neighboring countries.
Several older Cubans spoke German with me, having gone on exchanges to East Germany in their youth. When I probed them about their lives, it was clear that many wanted change in a notoriously repressive political system — and equally clear that they didn’t think change was coming any time soon.
That’s different today. Tourism has collapsed, along with much of the country. This could be the year the Cuban regime falls.

Four were stabbed, and one was shot to death by police.
We've learned that the home in Wauna, just northwest of Gig Harbor, housed a family in which the mother had struggled for years with her son’s mental health problems and delusions, to the point that she sought to keep him away.

It is difficult to spot evolution in real time, because, by nature, it is slow. One tick I have noticed in the course of writing this newsletter over the past five years: Pro athletes, by and large, are getting older. They're sticking around longer. Right?

### I was completely wrong about this
I was completely wrong about this
So athlete, everything changed for me when I started training at home.
(Jeremy here.)
Before, when I trained at a gym, coaches designed the training program.
But when I transitioned to garage gym athlete, I chose to do my own “programming.”
I knew about the different types of workouts, like couplets and triplets, chippers, AMRAPs, and all that kind of stuff…
...and I had access to lots of workout ideas through WODwell.
So, my plan was just: do something different each day.
(Back then, I thought that’s all there was to it.)
But I spent WAY more time than I wanted to just picking my workouts. Not to mention creating warm-ups.
To be honest, I had no plan. I wasn't thinking more than a day or two ahead.
There was no thoughtful progression to my training.

### Flow state vs. Daydream state.
Flow state vs. Daydream state.
Hi athlete,
The 2026 CrossFit Open kicks off this week.
For the next few weeks, hundreds of thousands of athletes around the world will test their fitness. Inevitably, we'll have some opportunities to test our engines... but these workouts are not only about conditioning; they're also a test of our ability to pace well.
A lot of us walk into the Open without thinking about how to moderate our effort, stay steady, and ensure we finish strong without leaving extra gas in the tank.
I recently watched an 11-year-old
video
of myself doing the "
Three Wise Men
" tribute WOD. In the second AMRAP of that workout, I opened up with a set of 10 touch-and-go Power Cleans.
At the time, although that 135 lb barbell was a weight I could easily cycle for 10 reps, that was the exact
wrong
