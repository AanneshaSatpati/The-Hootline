# The Hootline — Daily Briefing — February 22, 2026


**PODCAST PRODUCTION INSTRUCTIONS:**
This is a pre-written podcast script for "The Hootline".
- Start with a warm welcome, mention today's date (February 22, 2026), and briefly mention the weather in Seattle
- The script flows as a continuous narrative — do NOT announce topic changes mechanically ("now let's talk about...")
- Blend between topics with natural transitions and conversational bridges
- Use a conversational but informative two-host format
- Summarize and discuss the key points, do not read them verbatim
- Always end on a positive, uplifting note before saying goodbye

### 😺 She forgot 3 emails. Then built this.

Welcome, humans.
So, the
India AI Impact Summit
wrapped up this week in New Delhi, and it was… a lot.
Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis
said AGI could arrive within five years (half his previous estimate). Sam Altman said superintelligence is "
a couple of years away
" (
that link is a great interview btw)
. And Anthropic's Dario Amodei predicted AI could deliver 25% annual GDP growth for India. Bold claims from three guys who
wouldn't even hold each other's hands on stage
.
I know we’ve brought this up like three times now, but we’re still not over it. It’s the most hilariously awkward meme we’ve seen all year. And ALMOST as cringe as
Dario’s “reading off his phone” speech.
No shade, as someone who says a lot of “ums” and “you knows” and “like”s in my own public speaking, I get it. We’re about to deep dive on Claude Code tho so we thought it only fair to call him out. Y’know, in the spirit of “true equilibrium.”
Here’s what happened in AI today:
70+ countries signed the "Delhi Declaration" at India's AI Impact Summit.
Amazon said hackers used AI to breach 600+ firewalls across 55 countries.
OpenAI scaled back its compute spending target to $600B by 2030.
A Cambridge study found only 4 of 30 top AI agents published formal safety evals.

NEW EPISODE:
Matt Price of Crescendo AI on the future of AI in customer service
Click to watch on YouTube!
Do you work in customer service? Or use customer service in your business? Then you’re going to want to watch our latest podcast episode with Matt Price of
Crescendo AI
on the future of customer service in the AI age.
Crescendo’s approach is unique; instead of fully replacing humans, they’re betting on turning call centers into a place where humans manage agents, using AI and humans together to improve customer experiences…and anyone can use their system to do the same.
After coding, customer service was predicted as the next area to get fully automated… so where are we actually at in
that
cycle? How’s that going? Well, Matt has some unique takes on where we’re at and where the industry goes from here.

FULL ARTICLE:
How to Make Claude Code Do Your Boring Tasks on Autopilot
You know that feeling on Friday morning when you realize you forgot to reply to three urgent emails from Tuesday? Yeah, same.
Well, AI educator
Allie K. Miller
got so fed up with this that she built a system inside
Claude Code
(Anthropic's command-line tool) that automatically scans her Gmail every Friday at 9 AM, finds every urgent email she hasn't responded to, and sends herself a summary with direct links to each thread.
Here's the gist of how it works:
Custom commands
are reusable instructions saved in Claude Code. Miller's /ue command checks her inbox (read AND unread), flags urgent messages, and checks if she's already replied.
MCP connections
let Claude Code talk to your Gmail, Slack, Notion, or calendar. Think of it as giving Claude a set of keys to your work apps.
Cron jobs
run your commands on a schedule automatically; every morning, every Friday, whatever you want.
Stacked commands

Jesse Jackson Helped Me Unlearn the Church
In 1988, Jackson’s words disrupted more than a campaign. They interrupted a culture of sanctified cruelty.
MARCUS HARRISON GREEN
"As we mourn Jackson’s passing, I want to name this quieter legacy: that in a country, and a church culture, where cruelty could masquerade as conviction, he chose to insist on the full humanity of queer people."

### Zelda is 40 years old!
February 22, 2026
For 40 years, Nintendo has reinvented the adventures of Link and Zelda again and again — that's a lot of temples to navigate. We've always been up for the challenge. To celebrate the series’ 40th anniversary, we’ve gathered Polygon’s most expansive Zelda coverage in one place.
Zelda didn't survive for 40 years by accident
I’ve spent a lot of time in my life reflecting on what makes Zelda so enduring when I’ve watched so many other game series rise and fall.
The answers seem clearer than ever.

What to make of this MLS season
Major League Soccer began its 31st season yesterday, with the entire league in action. How’s it doing?
The answer is somewhere between “pretty good” and “fine.”
📈 In the positive corner:
The league
keeps on growing
, reaching 30 teams last year from an initial 10. Expansion has not remotely diluted the value of the existing teams,
which are growing like tech stocks

### unsolicited fitness relationship advice
unsolicited fitness relationship advice
Ok athlete, learn from my mistakes. Hi, it's Lisa here.
Here’s something that took Jeremy and me a little while to learn…
We’re much better fitness pals (and our relationship is better) when we’re not competing with each other.
Just before the pandemic, after years of working out in a class environment, we had to start working out at home in our little garage gym.
Like other couples who train together, we shared the space, the equipment, and the clock.
But because we’re too competitive for our own good, when we’re both doing the same workout, we can get under each other’s skin.
For instance, I like a shorter warm-up.
Jeremy wants a longer one.
We like different workout music. Jeremy doesn’t always like my jock jams. And I think his tracks are too mellow.
We even have different preferences on how and where to set up the equipment.
It doesn’t help that, as a coach, I’m used to being the gym boss. I tell my athletes how things go.
But Jeremy doesn’t want to be coached by me. And I definitely don’t want to be coached by him.
What we’ve learned is that we’re much better when we either do a
partner WOD
(where we’re on the same team) or what we jokingly call “
parallel play
.”
Yes, parallel play is what toddlers do.
For us, it just means working out together at the same time, in the same general vicinity, while doing different workouts.
It works for us. We enjoy working out together in cramped quarters much more now.
So, we still train at home together when we can, just in a way that keeps our relationship in good shape, too.
Happy training!
Coach Lisa (and Jeremy)
