### He exposed the secrets of a scam compound — and somehow got out alive

Story of the Month
He Exposed the Secrets of a Scam Compound — and Got Out AliveA young engineer contacted a reporter from inside a giant cybercrime operation in the Golden Triangle. What happened next was as harrowing as it was heroic.By Andy GreenbergWired
IT WAS A
perfect June evening in New York when I received my first email from the source who would ask me to call him Red Bull. He was writing from hell, 8,000 miles away.
A summer shower had left a rainbow over my Brooklyn neighborhood, and my two children were playing in a kiddie pool on the roof of our apartment building. Now the sun was setting, while I — in typical 21st-century parenting fashion, forgive me — compulsively scrolled through every app on my phone.
The message had no subject line and came from an address on the encrypted email service Proton Mail: “vaultwhistle@proton.me.” I opened it.

If you’ve been following the headlines, you know chatbots can be quite dangerous for those going through crisis, or those susceptible to what’s called “AI psychosis.”
This has played out not just in the news, but across a series of high profile lawsuits. OpenAI got sued. Character.AI got sued. And clinical reports keep raising red flags. There's no denying that real harm has happened when people use generic AI chatbots for emotional support…
which makes sense, because they’re
tools that were never designed for it.
So what happens when someone actually builds an AI
specifically
for therapy?
Well, today, at 10AM PT / 1PM ET / 6PM GMT,

### 😺 Did Anthropic just abandon safety?

Welcome, humans.
Yesterday on TBPN, Salesforce CEO Marc Beinioff
called
off
the SaaSpocalypse
, called
out
the fact that AI lab Anthropic uses
seat-based pricing
in its enterprise plan as the ultimate bull case for the longevity of Salesforce’s own seat-based model (
such a good point)
, and also made
some hilarious dolphin noises
,
and while he was at it, some whale ones too.
Meanwhile, Martin Peers over at The Information
broke down the good news, bad news
of the Salesforce earnings report.
So...SaaSpocalypse just on hold, I guess?
Speaking of putting things on ice (
or should we say putting ice on things!)
… we’ve got some good AI news for folks who’ve been dealing with blizzards lately: robots who can shovel now!
Is this the most efficient form factor? Absolutely not (
maybe you'd be better off with the equivalent of a roomba with ski-wheels and a snow-plow on the front of it).
But is this very entertaining?
Absolutely yes.
Here’s what happened in AI today:

Two U.S. aircraft carrier groups and dozens of fighter jets, bombers and refueling aircraft are massed within striking distance of Iran; President Trump, according to my colleagues in D.C., is telling advisers that if the country doesn’t give up its nuclear program, he’s considering regime change options.

It is PM Modi’s second visit to Israel in nine years. The India-Israel relationship was elevated to the level of strategic partnership during his first visit to that country in July 2017. Netanyahu greeted the Indian Prime Minister with a warm hug, following which Modi was accorded a ceremonial welcome at the airport, located 20 km southeast of Tel Aviv. The Indian Prime Minister addressed Israel’s parliament later in the day and had a tete-a-tete with Netanyahu. The two leaders will hold wide-ranging talks on Thursday.

Credit: Victor Freitas
Today marks the start of the 2026 CrossFit Open, the 16th edition of the worldwide event since its inception in 2011.
Later today, the first of three workouts will be announced from Moffett Federal Airfield in Santa Clara County, CA. Immediately afterward, Jayson Hopper, Dallin Pepper, Austin Hatfield, and Colten Mertens will be the first to take it on live.
Four weeks ago, we analyzed the
Open registration numbers
using Mike Halpin's data from
Known & Knowable
.
We compared 2026 numbers with those from previous years and made some predictions about overall participation.
He’s continued to track leading up to today, and while registration remains open until the very end of the Open on March 16, let’s take a look at what we’re seeing so far.
