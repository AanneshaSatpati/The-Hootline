### 😺 AI can now drain your crypto wallet

😺 OpenAI built a crypto thief

Welcome, humans.
It’s Thursday, and you know what that means:
everyone has a lot of work to finish before Friday.
In that same spirit, we’ll keep today’s newsletter light.
First up:
Thanks to everyone who came out to our
live robot demo with Flexion Robotics
yesterday! If you want to watch just the robot demo,
check this video out
.
It looks like now that
SeeDance 2.0
is becoming
Cease-and-Desist-Dance
, it’s doing what Sora became notorious for:
meme-ing famous historical figures instead of copyrighted characters:
Ugh. Karl Marx WOULD work at Game Stop
For context: SeeDance is the new video AI model that is creating absolutely unreal looking Hollywood-level video footage, and now Hollywood is sending unreal amounts of legal letters to its creator, ByteDance.
Gee, it would be real nice if we could get some new guardrails in place for defining A. the limits of copyright law re: parody, when a computer can generate someone’s exact likeness, and B. an easy to use open standard (like MCP) for people and companies to license themselves or their popular characters to creators so both parties can make $$. Either we need
No Fakes
to pass ASAP or a Human Likeness Protocol; ideally both??
Here’s what happened in AI today:
OpenAI is ‘bout to start cashing some down payments on their $100B round.

Meta to challenge Apple with its first smartwatch — and it's reportedly launching this year (3 minute read)
Meta plans to release its first smartwatch sometime this year. Code-named Malibu 2, the smartwatch will offer health-tracking tools along with a built-in Meta AI assistant.

### A tub of lotion to cure dry skin

A tub of lotion to cure dry skin
February 19, 2026
This extra-thick lotion — for extra-dry skin — is more luxe than it appears
Michael Murtaugh/NYT Wirecutter
We’ll be the first to admit that this magical tub of extra-moisturizing cream isn’t much to look at. But what it lacks in glamour, it more than makes up for in effectiveness. One panelist noticed that it almost immediately softened the appearance of craggy, callous skin along her ankles. Simply put: For cracked, irritated, or sensitive skin, you really can’t do better.

## SEGMENT 6: CrossFit (~2 minutes)
**Word budget: ~300 words**

### Will everyone laugh at me?

Will everyone laugh at me?
Ok athlete, I used to be a nervous wreck before I did a CrossFit class.
Hi, this is Lisa here.
At the rest of life, I was usually pretty confident…
But I was a CrossFit newbie back in 2013.
So, at the gym, everyone seemed to know better than me.
My mind would be racing with all sorts of questions:
Can I even do this?
Will everyone laugh at me?
Will I finish last and have to suffer the embarrassment of scaling everything?
Will I always be the one lifting less than everyone else?
I mean, the mere thought of going to class made me feel nauseous.
But I had the right plan: to stay consistent.
To do the work, whether I liked it or not (and most of the time I definitely did not).
But I kept going to class, despite the horrible butterflies.
And little by little, I got stronger. I got better.
