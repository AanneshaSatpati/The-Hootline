### 😺 Google: Your current AI just got demoted

😺 Google’s sharpest brain yet? 🧠

Welcome, humans.
Reddit is rolling up its sleeves and testing an
AI-powered search feature
that blends its discussion-driven content with product discovery and recommendations.
It lets users ask natural language questions and get shopping-relevant results right from Reddit. It’s an intriguing twist on traditional e-commerce search, one that leans on authentic user opinions rather than algorithmically curated storefronts. (
…and a creepy vibe for retail sales clerks almost as awkward as Anthopic’s
Dario Amodei refusing to shake Sam Altman’s hand

)
Here’s what happened in AI today:
Google released Gemini 3.1 Pro, scoring 98% on ARC-AGI-1.
OpenAI started testing ads in ChatGPT after the first response.

Go from "we don't support SSO" to Enterprise Ready in a weekend (Sponsor)
Every B2B company hits the same inflection point — enterprise customers show up and they need SSO, directory sync, audit logs, and role-based access before they'll move forward. Most teams lose months building that infrastructure. It doesn't have to be that way.
With
WorkOS
you get all of it. One platform for auth, identity, and security. Infrastructure for teams that ship fast and stay fast.
OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, and Perplexity already chose WorkOS over building it themselves.

Google’s “Century Bonds”
It is a striking paradox that Alphabet, a company built on the ephemeral shifting sands of software code, has chosen to issue financial instruments designed to outlast the vast majority of its employees.
The tech giant’s decision to issue “century bonds”—debt that will not mature until the 22nd century
—while sitting on a fortress balance sheet seems, at first blush, an act of financial eccentricity.

## SEGMENT 6: CrossFit (~2 minutes)

### High intensity training is for everybody

High intensity training is for everybody
Hi athlete, it's Jeremy here.
So, Coach Lisa and I have 3 kids.
When they were younger, we used to bring them to the gym with us in their strollers.
Now they’re a little older, and they still see us training every day. Except now it's mostly at home.
Two of our kids have started
working
out
with us (the third kid is still curious from a distance).
We’ve even gotten them some starter equipment, including a mini-barbell, lighter dumbbells, and their own set of rings.
When they want to join us, we modify our workout so they can do something that looks like what we’re doing
They started by doing a few burpees and walking away (I can’t blame them).
Now, they’ll try to figure out how many rounds they can do in an AMRAP and sometimes even do the whole WOD.
It’s awesome to see.
Although it would be cool if they stick with it, that’s not the point.
What we’re doing is demonstrating our values to our kids.
We’re showing them that health and fitness is a priority.
And that fitness is accessible to everyone, regardless of age or ability.
Everything is scalable. And intensity is relative.
Part of WODwell’s mission is to make fitness more accessible...to everyone.
It doesn’t matter where in the world you are.
Or what equipment you have.
Or whether you have access to a gym.
Anyone can do this. From anywhere.
And no, you
don't
have to get fitter before you start.
You can scale any workout for any ability level.
Our goal is to make it easier for anyone anywhere to discover and learn about the magic of "constantly varied functional movements, executed at a [relative] high intensity."
