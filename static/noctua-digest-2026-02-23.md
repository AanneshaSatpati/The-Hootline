Good morning, world!
The procession of Western leaders flocking to Beijing in recent weeks has been impressive. Last month, Mark Carney went, the first Canadian leader to visit in almost a decade. He signed a strategic partnership with a country that has imprisoned Canadian nationals and was accused of meddling in Canada’s elections.
Next up was Keir Starmer, reversing years of frosty relations in the first visit by a British leader since 2018. This week, it’s the German chancellor’s turn. More than a million German jobs depend on exports to China.
Not so long ago, Western countries talked about diversifying away from China. Now the opposite is happening. I called my colleague David Pierson, who covers China, to understand why.

## SEGMENT 6: CrossFit (~2 minutes)
**Word budget: ~300 words**

### the lie you’ve been told
the lie you’ve been told
Let's be honest athlete, too many people who consider themselves CrossFitters or functional fitness athletes have it all wrong.
Hi, it's Jeremy here.
So many Instagram athletes make it look like “more is better.”
More weight, more volume, more training days.
But here’s the truth: More is not better. Better is better.
“More” might get you some results in the beginning.
But, assuming you don't get injured first, you're going to plateau.
The more effective approach to sustainably developing high levels of functional fitness involves varying
loads
,
volume
,
duration
,
movement patterns
, etc.
What if you only train heavy, high-volume, long workouts? Then, a sprint workout like "
Fran
" would show you in 3-8 minutes exactly how big a hole you have in your fitness game. And vice versa if you just did "Fran" all the time.
And yes, bring the (relative) intensity on those high-intensity days. Put in the work. Clang and bang!
But play the long game and train for longevity. Prioritize recovery.
Despite what my younger self thought,
rest days
are an important part of growing gains.
And
mobility
. And
hydration
. And
sleep
.
Like many of WODwell’s members, Coach Lisa and I are parents with day jobs. For us, fitness is a hobby.
We train so we can live our lives outside the gym. So we can do all the things we love and be healthy while doing it … for the long term.
So, no. Regardless of what you see on social media, more is not better. Better is better.
Happy training!
Jeremy (and Coach Lisa)

That's it. And for a while, that's all it was. Every week I'd record another podcast, a discovery call, or a catch-up with an industry peer, and every week the note stayed vague because "Do something with transcripts" is the definition of a someday task without the "why" defined.
