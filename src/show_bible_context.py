"""Condensed show bible rules for Gemini tone/framing analysis."""

SHOW_BIBLE_RULES = """
SHOW: The Hootline — nightly news podcast, ~34 minutes, Seattle-based.
HOSTS: Tiya (female, Indian-born, PM/AI/badminton) and Derek (male, Seattle native, CrossFit coach/F1/Arsenal).
TONE: Sorkin-esque — fast, warm, witty, intelligent. Never stiff or robotic.
RULES:
1. India insider rule: Tiya covers Indian Politics, Indian Cricket, Badminton as someone from India — never as a foreign correspondent. No "in India, people believe..." constructions.
2. Two-host rule: Both hosts must be audibly present in every segment. No solo monologues.
3. Time anchoring: All forward references point to tomorrow (it's a nightly show).
4. Common thread: A unifying theme should connect 2-3 segments and pay off in the outro.
5. The Race: Both hosts compete to land the best line; one acknowledges the other in the outro.
6. Runtime: 28-38 minutes. Under 28 or over 38 is a problem.
