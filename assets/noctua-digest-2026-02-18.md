😺 🎙️Google's 100x Engineer & going live NOW w/ Sonnet 4.6 Demo
February 17, 2026   |
Listen Online
|
Read Online
Welcome, humans.
BREAKING:
Claude’s
Sonnet 4.6
just dropped;
we’re going LIVE right now
to test it out for the next hour. Come hang out!
Now, for today’s featured podcast release:
He built GitHub Copilot at Microsoft. Then he left for Google, built an AI coding tool in his terminal, and his team now ships
100 to 150 features and bug fixes every single week
—using AI to build itself.
In his
first-ever in-depth interview
about
Gemini CLI
, Google Principal Engineer Taylor Mullen came on the pod and revealed how he manages swarms of parallel AI agents, why the humble command-line terminal is having a full-on renaissance, and the viral “Ralph Wiggum” technique that recently made waves among devs on X and Reddit.
Click to watch on YouTube!
Here's our favorite parts:
(2:14)
The origin story:
Taylor built Gemini CLI at a hackathon two years ago—but scrapped it because AI was too slow and expensive. Fast forward to today and it's the most popular open-source CLI on GitHub.
(8:21)
The "holy crap" moment:
Taylor told Gemini CLI to clear his packed schedule, DM everyone affected, and reschedule—all while he was
at the gym
. Done in five minutes.
(17:24)
Live bug-fixing demo:
Taylor pastes a real GitHub issue URL into his terminal
without even reading the bug first
—and watches the AI solve it in real-time.
(18:47)
Spawning CLIs that spawn CLIs:
His team runs 7-10 parallel AI agents simultaneously—each one working on a different task, notifying the human only when it needs approval.
(23:05)
Conductor — "Planning dialed to 11":
Google's new extension doesn't just plan your project. It asks clarifying questions, writes implementation specs, self-improves over time, and helps your
whole team
get smarter.
(45:01)
"10x is the new normal":
Taylor's team has moved past the 10x engineer debate entirely. Everyone is 10x now. The question is how you get to 100x—and the answer is parallelism.
(45:56)
The Ralph Wiggum Technique:
The viral prompting method sweeping developer Twitter. Feed the AI's output back into the same prompt, over and over, until the answer is polished. Taylor runs it 5 times. Every time.
(31:54)
Why it's open source:
"With a tool this powerful, how else do you trust it?" Over a million users are helping build and audit Gemini CLI in the open—every single day.
Why watch this?
Because Taylor's live demos at
(17:24)
and
(23:05)
will show you exactly how to use a “CLI” / command line interface terminal agent actually works, which will help demystify it for you whether you want to try Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Codex, or any other tools.
Watch and/or Listen now:
YouTube
|
Spotify
|
Apple Podcasts
P.S.
Taylor's team prefers Gemini 3 Flash over Pro for almost everything—and he's only fallen back to Pro
10 times in the last month.
Find out why at
(43:44)

NEW: Gemini CLI Just Got a Self-Correcting Upgrade
Timed with our interview, Google just launched
Conductor's Automated Reviews
—a major new feature for Gemini CLI that automatically audits AI-generated code for security risks, style compliance, and accuracy against your original plans.
Why it matters:
The biggest concern with AI-written code isn't speed—it's trust. This update makes Gemini CLI the first major terminal tool to close the loop: the agent writes code, tests it,
and peer-reviews its own work
—all before a human ever sees it.
What Automated Reviews actually check:
Code quality:
Flags race conditions, null pointer risks, and logic errors—not just syntax.
Plan compliance:
Verifies every phase of your roadmap was addressed. No skipped requirements.
Security scanning:
Catches hardcoded API keys, potential data leaks, and injection vulnerabilities.
Test-suite validation:

### 😸 Anthropic's two rules the Pentagon hates

*Source: The Neuron*

😸 Pentagon vs. Anthropic is getting ugly
February 17, 2026   |
Listen Online
|
Read Online
Welcome, humans.
ChatGPT users are
losing it on Reddit
right now. Apparently GPT-5.2 has gone full unsolicited therapist. Ask it about an Excel formula? "Let's slow this down. You're not crazy for feeling this way." Ask about a
cake browning too quickly
? It decides you're panicking. One user asked about life insurance and got: "Sorry you're going through this."
Sir, I am not dying. I'm just organizing paperwork.
Top comment on r/OpenAI: "Chat PTSD."
Which... yeah, honestly, same energy.
Meanwhile, Sam Altman
announced
that Codex weekly users tripled since January, from roughly ~1M to 3M if our calculations are correct. Funny thing about Codex: as a model, you give it an assignment, and it mostly buggers off and goes and does stuff.
No therapy speak required.
Guess that makes Codex the strong, silent type… Dad? Is that you??
Speaking of numbers going up:
The Neuron just crossed
650,000+ daily subscribers
, and our podcast is approaching
30,000 combined subs
across Spotify, Apple, and YouTube.
WOW!
Thank you for being here.
Seriously.
We couldn’t do any of this without you.
Now, if you’re a reader AND a builder in this space, we
have a few Q1 advertising slots still available
in both the newsletter and the podcast.

SeeDance 2.0

P.S:
That’s pretty fast. Have you SEEN some of
these new SeeDance demos
? People are fixing their childhood trauma
be them 80s kids
or
90s kids
, or in the case of the below, creating entirely new traumas! Point is, SeeDance is scary good…
“I just wanted to feel it more” had me DECEASED. You can probably skip the rest after that one
Here’s what happened in AI today:
The Pentagon threatened to pull a $200M contract with Anthropic over Claude's military usage restrictions.
Sam Altman said OpenAI Codex tripled its weekly users since January, growing from ~1M to ~3M.
A new study found AI agents fail at 97.5% of real-world freelance jobs
Alibaba released Qwen 3.5, their new Claude and GPT killer model.
The Pentagon Wants to Drop Anthropic. That Might Be the Best Ad Anthropic's Ever Gotten.
Here's a sentence you don't hear every day: the U.S. military is threatening to punish an AI company for being
too ethical
.
Axios reported
that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is "close" to cutting ties with Anthropic and designating it a "supply chain risk," a label normally reserved for foreign adversaries like Chinese tech firms. The reason? Anthropic won't give the Pentagon blanket permission to use Claude for "all lawful purposes."
Anthropic's two red lines: no mass surveillance of Americans and no weapons that fire without a human involved.
The Pentagon's response, per a senior official: "We are going to make sure they pay a price for forcing our hand like this."
Here's what makes this wild:
Claude is the
only AI model currently running on the military's classified systems
.
It was
used during the Maduro raid
in January.
Pentagon officials openly praise its capabilities.
The contract in question is worth up to $200M, a fraction of Anthropic's $14B annual revenue.
But the real threat is the "supply chain risk" label, which would force
every company doing business with the Pentagon
to certify they don't use Claude (
this would potentially knock Claude out of Microsoft Copilot, for example)
.
That's a big deal when
8 of the 10 biggest U.S. companies
already use it.
Meanwhile,
OpenAI, Google, and xAI have all agreed to remove their safeguards for military use on unclassified systems. Anthropic is the only one holding out.
The
Reddit reaction
was immediate and almost unanimously pro-Anthropic:
Top comment on r/ClaudeAI: "This is a selling point. Make it an ad."
Multiple users said they were upgrading their subscriptions specifically to support the company.
One defense contractor
pointed out
that many companies would rather drop their government contracts than rip Claude out of their workflows.

“This tool has undoubtedly leveled up my cooking”
February 17, 2026
This weight is the key to perfect grilled cheeses (and beyond)
Maki Yazawa/NYT Wirecutter
Sure, you could slap a few Kraft squares onto white bread and nuke it in the microwave or throw it in a pan. But an obnoxiously loud crunch is arguably the most important part of a good grilled cheese — and a spatula can only get you so far.
Enter: this stainless-steel weight. It maximizes contact with the pan for more-even searing, faster cooking, and crispier results. For ooey-gooey grilled cheeses, yes, but also crispy chicken thighs, crackly fish, and perfectly charred bok choy.

In Short: Looksmaxxing, smart glasses and wrestling

February 17, 2026
Good morning! Have you ever been recorded at a restaurant? Influencers are all over New York City, but thankfully, I've been marked safe from getting papped. Recently, though, creators have started using smart glasses to record videos, meaning that service workers and customers are becoming captive participants.
My friend Luke Fortney has the story.

Jesse Jackson’s death
: Jackson, a civil rights leader and former presidential candidate, died today at 84. An impassioned orator, he was
the most influential Black figure
in the years between the civil rights work of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the election of Barack Obama.
Iran:
Indirect
talks ended
between the United States and Iran today, with the two countries making “good progress,” Iran’s foreign minister said. President Trump has called on Tehran to reach a deal or face the threat of a possible U.S. attack.
Netflix-Warner Bros. deal:
Warner Bros. Discovery said today that it would
restart deal talks with Paramount
, giving the company another chance to best Netflix for an agreement. Warner Bros. Discovery rejected Paramount’s deal last year, but Paramount has since amended its offer.

U.S. colleges and universities are chronically searching for cash, which brought some academic leaders into the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s orbit and inbox. Now,

### The World: AOC vs. Trump

*Source: The New York Times*

The World: AOC vs. Trump
|
nytimes.com
February 17, 2026
By
Katrin Bennhold
Good morning, world!
Maybe the most intriguing thing for me at the Munich Security Conference this past weekend was this: The Trump administration wasn’t the only focus. Half a dozen Democrats with potential presidential ambitions were trying out their messages ahead of midterm elections in the fall.
These elections will be a big test for President Trump, but also for his opponents. Democrats will have to come up with a compelling alternative vision of America if they hope to take control of Congress.
I was able to grill one of them myself on a panel about populism: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive from New York who has raised her profile in recent months.
Also:

It’s Dumpling Week

Gordon Welters for The New York Times
The Democrats trying to ‘fix this’
Over the past year, most headlines about America have been headlines about Trump.
With the notable exception of Zohran Mamdani, a left-winger who got attention around the world when he was elected as mayor of New York, Democrats have barely been visible abroad.
But in the run-up to the midterm elections in November, that may be changing. Half a dozen prominent Democrats traveled to the Munich Security Conference this past weekend.
The governor of California, Gavin Newsom, told European leaders that the state was a “stable and reliable partner” on climate change. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut condemned Trump for alienating “our friends in Europe.” Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona tried to reassure those friends: “I think we can fix this. I think we can get past this. It’s going to take a new president.”
There were so many potential presidential contenders in attendance, one political strategist joked that Munich had turned into Iowa, where White House hopefuls flock at the start of the primary season.
Which Democrats end up running in 2028 is still a wide open question. The more immediate question is what alternative vision do Democrats have to offer American voters for their country and the world? And how different does it have to be from the one that lost in the last election?
One counter project not just to MAGA but also to past Democratic politics is emerging on the populist left of the party, which was energized by Mamdani’s win. I spoke to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who has long been considered a potential presidential candidate and was closely followed by the world’s media in Munich.

The A.O.C. factor
Ocasio-Cortez burst onto the political scene as a disrupter inside her own party. A waitress who struggled to pay rent, she won office seven years ago, campaigning to raise the minimum wage and to expand public health insurance.
She’s been trying to steer Democrats toward her working-class message ever since. And as
my colleague Kellen Browning wrote recently
, plenty of Democrats now look to her, not party leaders, for how to get that message across.
At the Munich conference, she was characteristically direct on a panel on the rise of populism. (You can
watch our conversation here
.) I asked her whether her party had betrayed its working-class base.
“I consistently saw a party that championed special interests, the elite,” she said. “A Democratic Party that was very much kind of telling working people that everything was fine when it in fact wasn’t.”
She said the party had come a long way since she first ran in 2018 but not far enough. One thing she said needed to happen “expeditiously” was a wealth tax. Another was antitrust policies to prevent the concentration of what she called “abusive” corporate power.
She directly linked the rise of authoritarianism to rising inequality. Ordinary people, she said, were turning away from democracy because wealthy elites were rigging the system in their favor.
“They start to call the shots, and we’re starting to see this with some of the billionaire class throwing their weight around in domestic politics and in global politics as well,” Ocasio-Cortez said.

### The Evening: Diplomacy without diplomats

The Evening: Diplomacy without diplomats
|
nytimes.com
February 17, 2026
By
Matthew Cullen
Good evening. Here’s the latest at the end of Tuesday.
American envoys negotiate in Geneva
A sewage spill pollutes the D.C. area
Plus, happy Mardi Gras!
Jared Kushner, left, and Steve Witkoff in Switzerland last month.
Gian Ehrenzeller/Keystone, via Associated Press
Trump officials negotiate two high-stakes deals at once
This morning in Geneva, an American delegation led by two of President Trump’s most trusted envoys — his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and the real estate developer Steve Witkoff — held indirect nuclear talks with Iranian officials. The discussions, during which U.S. negotiators were hoping to address concerns about Iran’s nuclear and missile programs,
made “good progress,”
Iran’s foreign minister said.
By afternoon, Kushner and Witkoff were
sitting down with Russian and Ukrainian
leaders in another room in Geneva, attempting to help broker a peace deal. Trump began his second term vowing to end the conflict, but in many ways the
war has only worsened
.
Expectations for a cease-fire in Ukraine are low, in large part because the sides are far apart on the two major issues: the fate of Ukraine’s borders and the extent to which Western countries will help defend Ukraine after the war.
The dueling talks in Switzerland were a stark example of Trump’s belief that the State Department and the National Security Council, which have coordinated negotiations over global crises for decades, are
best left on the sidelines
. My colleagues David Sanger and Anton Troianovski described the strategy as “diplomacy without diplomats.”
Five people who are facing repercussions in the wake of the release of the Epstein files.
The Epstein emails have rocked several industries
More than a dozen high-profile figures across politics, finance, entertainment, law and academia have been fired or pushed out of their positions after their ties to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein emerged in the Justice Department’s latest release of files. A few have been charged with crimes or are under investigation. Today,
we published a new page where we’re tracking the fallout
. (We removed the paywall for readers of this newsletter so you can read it for free.)
One exception to the rippling repercussions seems to be Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary. The files showed that his interactions with Epstein went beyond how he had previously described them. So far,
the White House has shrugged off their association

America pays tribute to Jesse Jackson (1941-2026)
Presidents, religious leaders and many others publicly mourned the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the charismatic civil rights leader
who died today at 84
. Trump called Jackson “a good man,” Joe Biden described him as a “a man of God and of the people,” and Al Sharpton described him as his mentor and “a transformative leader.”
The Times recalled some of the most important moments in Jackson’s life: his difficult childhood, his time as a protégé of Martin Luther King Jr., his populist vision of a “rainbow coalition” of the poor and forgotten, his influence over generations of Black Democrats, his self-inflicted controversies and his failed presidential campaigns.

D.C.-area sewage spill becomes a political fight
Hundreds of millions of gallons of raw human waste have gushed into the Potomac River just outside of Washington, D.C., since a major sewer line collapsed last month. The spill
appears to be the largest discharge of its kind in the nation’s history
, threatening the health of the river and the safety of those who use it. (It also smells terrible.)
Local officials have been working for weeks to stop the flow and assess the damage. Now, the spill has become entangled in national politics: Trump and Maryland’s governor, Wes Moore, are blaming each other for the disaster. FEMA said today that it was monitoring the situation.

There’s a better way to stop price gouging.

### The Morning: Reporting on Epstein

*Source: The New York Times*

The Morning: Reporting on Epstein
|
nytimes.com
February 17, 2026
By
Sam Sifton
Good morning.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson has died at 84
. Negotiators from the U.S. and Iran
are meeting in Switzerland
to discuss Iran’s nuclear program. And talks on ending the war in Ukraine are happening, but
hopes for a breakthrough are low
.
I’m going to start today, though, with a story some readers think we should start with every day: the Jeffrey Epstein files.
There are an estimated 180,000 images in the latest release of the Epstein files.
Martin Bureau/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images
The big dig
It’s hard to imagine a more difficult reporting project. For the past couple of weeks, dozens of Times journalists have been making their way through the three million pages in the latest collection of Epstein files released by the Justice Department, along with 180,000 images and 2,000 videos. To date they’ve examined only a small percentage of what’s there — much of it uncorroborated, fragmented or redacted. Many months, maybe years, of work are ahead of them as they dredge the documents for information they can verify and publish.
Readers have questions about that. How is The Times searching the files? What’s the objective of the search? Do we use artificial intelligence to assist with our reporting? What do we publish and, as important, what do we
not
publish?
Patrick Healy, an assistant managing editor who oversees The Times’s journalistic standards, talked with four of the journalists who are working on the Epstein files to
kick around those questions
. Here’s some of what he learned.
What’s in the files
. Receipts, basically: emails, text messages, bank records, witness statements, multimedia files. “We almost never get a chance to see the investigative materials underlying any case,” said Kirsten Danis, our Investigations editor. “Reporters always wish we had subpoena power. In this case, it was like we did.”
How the team searches the files
. Printed out, the Epstein files could be stacked to the height of the Empire State Building. You’d spend a lifetime reading them. So journalists started with search terms: Clinton, Trump, Duke of York, Gates. Steve Eder, an investigative reporter who has been on the Epstein story on and off for the past six years, worked with his colleagues to make a list of terms. Then they used those queries to scour the files for news. They’ve added new search terms every day.
Artificial intelligence helps.
The technology allowed the team to build tools to parse the Epstein files in just a couple of days. “That would normally take engineering teams weeks to build,” said Dylan Freedman, an editor on our A.I. projects team. And Andrew Chavez, a newsroom engineer, helped with “semantic search,” which lets journalists hunt for concepts rather than matching exact language in a document. But A.I. isn’t perfect. In fact, it’s really bad at news judgment, Dylan said: “A.I. can be sloppy and make mistakes that are inexcusable in journalism. It’s super industrious but not super intelligent.”
What they’re looking for.
Evidence of how Epstein went about doing what he did — and how he got away with so much for so long. Evidence of who funded his activities. Evidence of the people he sought out. The files have not delivered clear proof of blackmail, at least from what the team has seen, Steve said, but “they give us a fuller picture of how Epstein interacted with powerful people and how he seemed to see value in claiming to know things about them.”
On President Trump.

Apalachee Trial Begins
Opening statements began yesterday in the trial of
Colin Gray
, the father of Apalachee High School shooting suspect Colt Gray. The elder Gray has pleaded not guilty to 29 charges, including second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter.
In September 2024, then-14-year-old Colt allegedly killed four people and wounded nine others at his high school in Winder, Georgia. Colt’s father had purchased the AR-15-style rifle for Colt as a Christmas gift and had also purchased a larger magazine for extra rounds. The gift came despite a visit from police over threats Colt allegedly made to carry out a school shooting (no charges were filed;
see video
). Colt had also allegedly kept a shrine to a school shooter in his bedroom. Prosecutors say the elder Gray’s actions indicate “criminal negligence.”
The trial follows a relatively new approach by prosecutors to charge parents of school shooters. The first instance came in 2021, with charges against the
Crumbley parents
, whose son killed four students in Oxford, Michigan.
Fat Tuesday Arrives
Cities around the world
celebrate Mardi Gras
today, the final day before the Christian fasting and religious observance period of Lent begins. French for "Fat Tuesday," Mardi Gras caps Carnival, which starts annually Jan. 6—the 12th day after Christmas—and ends the day before Ash Wednesday. Celebrations include weeks of parades, masked balls, and king cake-filled gatherings.
New Orleans is considered the US epicenter for festivities, drawing roughly 1 million visitors and generating around $900M in economic impact (although Mobile, Alabama, claims the first American Mardi Gras in 1703). Social clubs known as krewes, like Rex and Zulu, roll through the city in elaborate floats, tossing beads and doubloons. Roughly 2.5 million pounds of trash are produced each year, including nearly 100,000 pounds of beads, prompting the development of new
biodegradable throws
.
Mardi Gras
evolved
from ancient Roman festivals into a global event, from Rio de Janeiro's samba parades to Venice's masked balls. See photos

.
Lost Ship Discovered
Researchers have found
the Lac La Belle
, a luxury passenger ship that sank in Lake Michigan more than 150 years ago. The 217-foot steamer was discovered 20 miles offshore between Racine and Kenosha, Wisconsin. See images of the ship, including stereoviews,
here
.
The Lac La Belle was built in Cleveland in 1864. The ship sank twice—the first time in 1866 after a collision on the St. Clair River. After being restored in 1869, the ship was purchased by a Milwaukee-based company. On Oct. 13, 1872, the ship left the city with 53 passengers and crew, as well as goods, including barley, flour, pork, and whiskey. After two hours, it began leaking uncontrollably and encountered a storm, forcing passengers to escape by lifeboat. Eight people died.
Eighty-year-old shipwreck hunter Paul Ehorn discovered the hull via sonar in October 2022 and waited to announce its discovery until he created a 3D model of the ship. Learn more about shipwrecks via 1440 Topics

The Lithium Boom is Heating Up
Thanks to growing demand, lithium stock prices grew 2X+ from June 2025 to January 2026. $ALB climbed as high as 227%. $LAC hit 151%. $SQM, 159%.
But the real winner may be a stock

EnergyX
. This $1B unicorn’s
patented technology
can recover up to 3X more lithium than traditional methods. That’s earned investment from leaders like General Motors. Now they’re preparing for commercial production just as experts project 5X demand growth by 2040. They’ve
announced what could be one of the US’ largest lithium production facilities
and have rights to approximately 150,000 lithium-rich acres across North and South America.

## SEGMENT 6: CrossFit (~2 minutes)

### Welcome to WODwell

*Source: WODwell*

Welcome to WODwell
Welcome athlete, we’re excited you’re here!
You’re one step closer to your next awesome Workout Of the Day (WOD).
Real quick, here’s what to expect from us:
Starting now, you’re receiving a short series of daily welcome emails. Keep an eye out for 1 email each day for about the next week or so. This will help get you started.
After that, we’ll send you ~2 emails per month, with functional fitness stories and insights for independent athletes (plus some
featured WODs
).
We only send emails to people who find them useful. (All you have to do is open our emails to stay on the list.)
WODwell was created by a husband and wife team:
Lisa
is a globally influential coach (CrossFit Level-2, OPEX, and BirthFit certified) who runs both an in-person private training practice and an online training program for females.
Jeremy
discovered CrossFit in 2011 and spends a lot of his time outside of his tech business career thinking about how to make functional fitness available to everyone, everywhere.
(and yes, Lisa is the fitter one).
We started WODwell in 2014 to share functional fitness with the world. Over time our approach has evolved:
The magic that happens inside the 4 walls of a gym, with dedicated coaches and a vibrant community, is unbeatable.
But after our 3rd kid arrived in 2017, our lives got too busy for our gym commute. We made the tough decision to leave our local gym to train out of our garage. And we were pleasantly surprised how effective and efficient our training became.
We remain committed to serving the global community of "independent" functional fitness athletes...which includes those who, like us, don't currently have the luxury of training at a gym.
And we believe that
emerging technology can help
make functional fitness more accessible to anyone...regardless of where they train.
In our next email, we’ll talk about how functional fitness changed our lives (and how this kind of training methodology can change your life too).
Happy training!
Coach Lisa and Jeremy
Co-Creators, WODwell

high-quality creatine!
I’ve long benefitted from creatine for athletic and gym performance, and now I’m increasing my daily intake to enjoy the cognitive benefits. A pilot study in Alzheimer’s patients demonstrated that supplementing can increase brain creatine levels in just 8 weeks, improving measures of memory, reasoning, and attention. And a double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that creatine can restore aspects of memory and attention within hours in adults who are sleep deprived. I use
Momentous Creatine
made with Creapure®, which is sourced from Germany and has the strictest lab standards to ensure it’s at least 99.9% pure. And try Momentous’s
Creatine Chews—clean chewable tablets with 1 gram of Creapure® creatine per chew
—and their
whey protein isolate
and
magnesium threonate
, all of which meet their same, exacting standards.

### Multiple NFL stars on the move?

*Source: The Athletic Pulse*

By
Chris Branch
and
Torrey Hart
Good morning! Scroll for your daily dose of inspiration. Coming up:
🏈 Big NFL
questions
🛷
Olympics
roundup
👕 MLS
kit reveal
Primers
Mitchell Leff / Getty Image
What to follow this NFL offseason
We’ve talked plenty about football season being “over,” but if we look inward with honesty, we know that isn’t fully true. Football is king in this country, and the NFL intentionally tries to make it a 12-month sport, interest-wise (moves like
the Dolphins releasing Tyreek Hill
first thing on a football-less Monday help, too).
Thus, the offseason is a season in itself. And, as Jacob Robinson
detailed
in Scoop City last week, there are burning questions to answer. So I picked my favorites and pressed Jacob to answer them.
Enjoy:
Will Maxx Crosby and/or A.J. Brown be traded?
Both are 28-year-old superstars who are clearly unhappy with their current franchises. Crosby
seems to be open
to mending fences with the Raiders after the team hired Klint Kubiak as coach, but the front office that left him miffed last year remains in place.
Brown, meanwhile, was lost in the Eagles’ muddied offense last year and consistently made his dissatisfaction known publicly. There seems to be
less talk
of reconciliation there.
Both are players you want on your team … which makes them both candidates to bring in a big haul if a trade becomes necessary.
What’s our most likely outcome here?
💬
Jacob:
Both get moved. Their respective teams are better off keeping their stars, of course, but draft picks and cap savings can be tempting. Just ask Jerry Jones. It doesn’t help that Crosby and Brown seemed disillusioned with their organizations last season, and I’d guess both welcome a change of scenery. There should be plenty of teams willing to meet the asking prices.
What do the Colts pay Daniel Jones?
I involuntarily muttered “oof” as I typed that. The Colts are in a tough spot: probably on the hook to pay Jones many millions of dollars for a long-term deal after he played well in 13 games last year. But it was just 13 games, and his entire career leading up to the renaissance gave plenty of reason for caution.
Indianapolis is also out two first-round picks after acquiring Sauce Gardner at the trade deadline, just before the season went belly-up.
So, what do they pay Jones, and, the follow-up I’m more curious about, should they pay him at all?
💬
Jacob:
Do they have a choice? The quarterback market is bleak in free agency and the draft, so letting Jones leave the building would be an enormous risk for a general manager whose job security is tenuous. They need Jones more than he needs them, as hard as that is to believe. The baseline is Sam Darnold’s $33.5 million average, though Jones likely gets closer to $40 million. Again.
What happens on the veteran QB carousel?
Jacob called this an “Unexciting Faces in New Places” list, which feels apt. Think of players like Tua Tagovailoa, Kyler Murray, Kirk Cousins, Geno Smith, etc. There are open jobs to be had, of course.
We have
an entire discussion from December
about this, but I want to drill down: What potential new pairing of QB and team makes the most sense?
💬
Jacob:
It’s not new, per se, but Kirk Cousins to the Vikings makes sense. Why not reunite him with head coach Kevin O’Connell and give Minnesota veteran competition to J.J. McCarthy? A sneaky fit: Packers backup Malik Willis joining the Browns. He’d work with a young team and coach Todd Monken, who helped Lamar Jackson have the best passing season of his career in 2024. Willis has the potential to be a Jackson-lite.
Many thanks to Jacob for playing along. He’ll be at the NFL Scouting Combine next week for us, so
subscribe to Scoop City
for offseason enlightenment.

The longer I do business the more I realize that communication is the key to success.
How your company communicates with its customers is the most important part of how you do business.
How does your website read? How do your proposal emails read? How well can your team get their point across in an email?
Email is the primary method of communication in the American economy.
Writing great emails separates the winners from the losers and very few business owners focus on it.
Nick Huber
@sweatystartup
Half of running a company is teaching all of your employees to send clear, concise and direct emails.
Word salad is extremely costly.
Emails are a reflection of how somebody thinks.
Teach people how to think and replace them if they can’t do it.

The most valuable thing you can do as a business owner is improve the written emails that your team sends. From sales to delivery to service to billing. Great emails work and poor emails cost you money.
Here’s how to write a great email:
Make it short and concise.
The most productive people at my companies send 30 word emails. Sometimes 80 words. Never over 200 words.
Cut the fluff. If it doesn’t directly help you get your point across or get the information you need in return it should be cut.
Remove the fillers and pleasantries and sentences that don’t accomplish #1.
Long emails get less responses. They are easier to procrastinate responding to. And most of the time people don’t actually read them.
Make it direct.
Nobody has time to scan an email and try to figure out what you need, who’s job it is to find it, or what the next step is for them.
It should have a direct ask or question. And that question should be simple and easy to discern from the email itself.
Add a few exclamation points to soften the harshness!
Lets go over an example.
Good email:
Jim,
Meet Steve, he can find you a CFO and save you a ton of money over hiring in America.
Are you free tomorrow at 10am EST to sync with him? If not throw out a few times and he’ll send an invite.
Thanks,
Bad email:
Jim,
I hope that you are having a wonderful day and it was great to catch up with you a few hours ago to learn about your growing company! Congratulations on the recent growth and all of your success!
Steve is a sales executive on my team and is an amazing person to talk to about your executive search. We can help you find a finance professional and I recommend South Africa and Egypt where the cost of living is really low but the finance talent is exceptional.
Here’s how it works with our company:
We set up a call to learn more about your business
We recruit an awesome person for you
You interview and we help you hire them
We guarantee the hire for 6 months
If it fits into your schedule it would be great to connect with Steve to discuss this further so he can learn more about your business and how to help you in the coming days.
Thanks again for your time. I really appreciate it!
—
Okay I’m cutting it short there but you get the point. Nobody wants to read all that. Nobody will respond.
Be direct and get the point across in as few words as possible!
Train your team to do this and your company will grow.

### Have blue eyes? Read this...

All blue-eyed people likely descended from a single ancestor.
Eyes are said to be the windows to the soul, but they’re also a glimpse at humanity’s genetic past. Scientists estimate that between
6,000 and 10,000 years ago
, the eye color of all Homo sapiens individuals was brown — likely an evolutionary advantage, as the melanin pigment offers some protection from UV radiation. But then, something changed. Sometime during the Neolithic expansion in Europe, an individual was born with a mutation to the OCA2 gene. This gene code controls melanin production in the iris, and the mutation caused this person’s eyes to turn blue rather than the usual brown. Because blue eyes can only form as a result
of this mutation
, scientists theorize that all blue-eyed people —
about 10%
of the world population — are a relative of this original lone blue-eyed ancestor.
Strangely, this mutation doesn’t actually turn your eyes blue — in fact,
blue eyes are technically not blue at all.
The eye’s iris is predominantly made up of two layers: the stroma and the epithelium. Brown eyes have a brown-black melanin pigment in both these layers (though the stroma absorbs the most light), which produces the color brown. Blue eyes, on the other hand, have no melanin pigment in the stroma; in fact, blue eyes have no pigment at all. Instead, they are a reflection of white light in a process called the Tyndall effect. Because blue wavelengths of light are the shortest, they are reflected the most by the fibers in the eyes, which absorb the longer red-orange wavelengths. This bit of complicated optics is similar to how the atmosphere reflects sunlight, turning the sky (and the ocean) a dazzling blue. So while the overall effect is that people have “blue” eyes, from a pigment perspective, the truth is that they
really don’t have any color at all

Chuck Norris Swears This Is the Key to Healthy Aging
Yes, Chuck Norris is best known for his acting and martial arts chops, but he also has some advice when it comes to graceful aging. At 85, he has more energy than most people his age, and even those decades younger. He found his key to healthy aging — and it was by going against some of the most popular advice out there.Curious about Norris’ approach? He shares his entire method in this 15-minute video explaining the three “internal enemies” wrecking our health as we age and the simple ways we can combat them using foods and herbs you probably already have at home.

Humans are less genetically diverse than other primates.
Humans are the
least genetically diverse among the great apes
. This means that we’re a relatively young species, as enough time hasn’t passed for mutations to accumulate (200,000 years is a geologic blink of an eye). It also means that Homo sapiens likely sprung from a surprisingly small population —
around just 10,000 breeding pairs or so.
This may be because early humans appear to have survived two genetic bottlenecks while exiting Africa, both of which caused the population to plummet. One theory suggests humans almost went extinct 74,000 years ago
due to a massive volcanic eruption
, but other studies question if that “eruption”
was actually an epidemic
. Usually, this low diversity can make it tougher for animals to adapt to climatic changes. Fortunately, what humans lack in genetic brawn, we make up for
with our incredibly complex brains
